[sniper](sniper.sh) and [spotter](spotter.sh) need some story-telling. As Employer's Atlassian infrastucture grew, JAVA developers were pulled off the street, told they were specialists and told to write plugins. A product manager was assigned and told that their decisions were final. This led to plugins being developed on a much-newer verion of JIRA running in a test lab than the one deployed to production. Your faithful author's objections were overruled because "the buisiness wouldn't accept it". This plugin relied on a different verion of Jetty, and if called too-frequently would cause JIRA to unceremoniously crash. 

An indicator of an impending crash was "com.sun.jersey.api.client.filter.HTTPBasicAuthFilter" messages in the JIRA log. [spotter](spotter.sh) was cron-ned to run every 60 seconds checking for jersey messages in the log, and if more than 3 appeared within the last 90 seconds the plugin would be disabled by [sniper](sniper.sh) disabling it in the UPM with a REST call.

[violet](https://github.com/lbonanomi/scripts/blob/master/jira/violet.php): Violet was the tool for recreating Agile boards and sprint data from a legacy JIRA-6 instance to a fleet of JIRA-7 instances. This tooling subsumes previous tools "red" and "blue", hence the name.
